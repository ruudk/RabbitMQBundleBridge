# Routing

By default, this bundle assumes that you want to use "direct" exchanges and use one queue for all commands, and one
queue for all events. If you want to use "topic" exchanges and selectively consume messages using a routing key, this
bundle can generate routing keys automatically for you based on the class name of the `Message`. Just change the
bundle configuration:

```yaml
# in config.yml
simple_bus_rabbit_mq:
    # default value is "empty"
    routing_key_resolver: class_based
```

When for example a `Message` of class `Acme\Command\RegisterUser` is published to the queue, its routing key will be
`Acme.Command.RegisterUser`. Now you can define consumers for specific messages, based on this routing key:

```yaml
# in config.yml
old_sound_rabbit_mq:
    ...
    consumers:
        acme_commands:
            connection:       default
            exchange_options: { name: 'asynchronous_commands', type: topic }
            queue_options:    { name: 'asynchronous_commands', routing_keys: ['Acme.Command.#'] }
            callback:         simple_bus.rabbit_mq_bundle_bridge.events_consumer
```

## Custom routing keys {#custom-routing-keys}

If you want to define routing keys in a custom way (not based on the class of a message), create a class that
implements `RoutingKeyResolver`:

```php
use SimpleBus\RabbitMQBundleBridge\Routing\RoutingKeyResolver;

class MyCustomRoutingKeyResolver implements RoutingKeyResolver
{
    public function resolveRoutingKeyFor($message)
    {
        // determine the routing key for the given Message
        return ...;

        // if you don't want to use a specific routing key, return an empty string
    }
}
```

Now register this class as a service:

```yaml
services:
    my_custom_routing_key_resolver:
        class: MyCustomRoutingKeyResolver
```

Finally, mention your routing key resolver service id in the bundle configuration:

```yaml
# in config.yml
simple_bus_rabbit_mq_bundle_bridge:
    routing_key_resolver: my_custom_routing_key_resolver
```
